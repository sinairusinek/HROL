A regular expression, 
or regex is a sequence of characters
 that define a search pattern. 
 Usually this pattern is used by string searching algorithms for "find" or
 "find and replace" operations on strings, 
 or for input validation. 

 It is a technique that developed in theoretical 
 computer science and formal language theory.
Developed in the Regular expressions are used 
in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word 
processors and text editors, in text processing utilities 
and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide 
regex capabilities, built-in or via libraries.
Each character in a regular expression 
(that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) 
is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character 
that has a literal meaning. 
For example, in the regex a., a is a literal character which matches just 'a',
 while '.' is a meta character that matches every character except a newline. 
 Therefore, this regex matches, for example, 'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. 
 Together, metacharacters and literal characters 
 can be used to identify text of a given pattern, 
 or process a number of instances of it.
A very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a text editor, the regular expression seriali[sz]e matches both "serialise" and "serialize". Wildcards also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern, as they have fewer metacharacters and a simple language-base.

The regular expression seriali(s|z)e will also match "serialise" and "serialize".
